# Pothole Detection using YOLOv8  

This project uses **YOLOv8** for real-time pothole detection, drawing bounding boxes around all detected potholes. The trained model achieves **over 98% accuracy**, making it highly reliable for road damage detection applications.  

The repository also includes the **`best.pt`** trained weights file, so you can run detections right away without retraining.  

## Features  
- Real-time pothole detection  
- Bounding boxes for each detected pothole  
- Lightweight and fast YOLOv8 model  
- Achieves **98%+ accuracy** on test data  
- Includes **`best.pt`** trained weights in the repo
